## Design Principles
- **Simplicity First**: Few files, clear structure, easy to understand
- **Working Incrementally**: Each phase delivers a fully functional system
- **Good Practices**: Clean code without overengineering

## Plan for the next phase
1. add a tool, which takes note of user's weekly French learning goals (measured by hours).
2. add a tool, which takes note of the user's actual French learning time in a week. (remember also to implement a tool for checking the note.)
3. add a tool, which help user compare the weekly goal and the actual learning time to see if goal is reached.
4. add a tool, which enable the agent to check the calendar, so that when a new week comes, it knows it should ask user to set a new goal.
